# Aurora
__________

**Welcome to EOS Auora**

We are currently testing GIT COMMIT: a29e14b7

The PROTOCOL VERSION used for this launch is: 0xD34D

The GENESIS used is : 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EOSArgentina/aurora/master/genesis.json

An example CONFIG.ini is : 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EOSArgentina/aurora/master/config.ini

The Aurora testnet aims to be updated to the latest EOSIO software available.
We you can think of it as "the most similar to the future main-net".

We recommend everyone participating to have the network-version-match set to 1 in their config to reject peers not using the same p2p protocol.

We will be using the network protocol version on our BOOT node set to a magic value everytime we re-start the chain (we hope in very rare cases) or as soon as there is an important fix that breaks consensus. This is ()

We wil be testing everything we can: stress testing, buggy contracts, network splits, changing producers, etc.

We will be using this Telegram channel to coordinate everything Aurora related:

You can ping us anytime, we will try to be available most of the time!
